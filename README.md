2D Path Finder 2010 Matlab

This was a UC Berkeley E177 project written in Matlab.

The "Path_Finder" function in Path_Finder.m starts a GUI that allows a user to set initial condition on a 2D map, 
including obstacles, way-points, speed/turning angle, vision and or other limitations.  

The program  then simulate a simple vehicle moving around all the obstacles to get to desired destinations [via 
way-points, if set].  

For more details on how to use the GUI, please see the dropbox link below for detailed documentation.
